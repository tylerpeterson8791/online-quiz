// Start with two global variables set at zero to Start

// 1. A clicker that goes every time an answer is chosen, this will dictate what gets populated into the page when it flips. 0=Start Quiz page, 1 = q1 and so onabort.apply.apply.apply
// 2. A timer that starts when the quiz begins and stops when it ends? (does it have to be timed?)

// I need a way to track correct and incorrect.  Then on the final page this tally will be displayed.

// When clicker reaches a number the corresponding text is displayed in the question field and all the answer buttons.A

// Make buttons 2-4 invisible on start page (only have "start quiz" button) and final page (maybe a "try again" button).
// Declare these html pointers globally at the begining.A

// Acceptance Criteria

// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question

// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock

// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over

// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score
