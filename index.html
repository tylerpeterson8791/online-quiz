<!-- Pseudocode brainstorm

for html page basically has two sections, the header where the questions go and the body where the answers are selected

to begin the body has to be a start button, or maybe a blank "Click anywhere to begin" and listen to the whole page EXAMPLE HAS SINGLE START QUIZ BUTTON, THAT'LL PROBABLY BE EASIEST

after that header is the question itself and the body will be the multiple choice answers.  The example gives 4 options so have four buttons built out in html for js to populate

HTML should be pretty straightforward -->
